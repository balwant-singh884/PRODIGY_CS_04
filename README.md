# 🧠 Graphical Keylogger (Python + Tkinter) — Educational Use Only

This is a "GUI-based keylogger tool" developed using Python and Tkinter, designed "strictly for educational and demonstration purposes". It allows users to start, stop, view, and save keystroke logs in a visually intuitive interface.

> ⚠️ "Important:" This project is meant solely for ethical, authorized, and educational use. Never use keyloggers on systems without explicit permission. Unauthorized use is illegal and unethical.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Start/Stop keylogging with GUI buttons
- 🖥️ Real-time display of captured keystrokes in a Tkinter text widget
- 💾 Save captured keystrokes to a `keylog.txt` file
- 🔁 Background logging using multithreading
- 🎨 Simple and clean graphical interface

🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Educational Purpose:

To demonstrate how a keylogger works in a safe and controlled environment, primarily for learning and ethical demonstration purposes.

- Building a GUI Application:

To develop a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter and integrate it with background tasks (keylogging) without freezing the user interface.

- Keylogging Basics:

To understand how to capture keystrokes using the pynput library and handle keypress events.

To explore how to handle real-time data (keystrokes) and update a graphical interface accordingly.

- Multithreading in Python:

To learn and implement multithreading to run background processes (keylogging) while maintaining the responsiveness of the graphical interface.

- Data Logging and Saving:

To create a system that logs and stores captured keystrokes in a file (keylog.txt), demonstrating basic file I/O operations in Python.

- Ethical Hacking and Security Awareness:

To raise awareness about ethical hacking, ensuring that keyloggers are only used in environments where explicit permission is given, and to understand the security risks posed by malicious keyloggers.
